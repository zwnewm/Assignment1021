# Assignment1021
This is a practice repository for Assignment1021, which deals with cloning and changing the origin.

Tasks:
1. Find the repository https://github.com/ballard-high-ap-cs/Assignment1021 on GitHub, read the README.md file and browse its contents. See if you can deduce exactly what the program will do.
2. Clone the repository to a local folder on your workstation using GitHub Desktop
3. Change the origin of the repository so that it points to a new personal repository under your own GitHub account (not to the original ballard-high-ap-cs repository).
4. Change the code in your cloned repository so that it modifies the output in some way (for example, change a message or spelling).
5. Save and commit your changes to your local Git repository.
6. Push your changes to GitHub, then verify that your changes appear in your own repository, not in the ballard-high-ap-cs organization.
  *In your README, explain how you verified this*
7. Pair up with a classmate. Exchange your repository URLs with each other.
8. Change your repository’s origin to point to your classmate’s repository. Make a small change and attempt to push your changes to their repository.
9. In your repository’s README file, describe what happened when you tried to push your changes to their repository.  
   * What message did GitHub Desktop give you?
   * Why do you think this happened?
   * What does this reveal about how Git handles remote permissions?
